# Bookshelf-API

This project is an API for managing books. It provides endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books. The API allows users to perform operations such as adding a new book, retrieving all books, retrieving a specific book by ID, updating a book's information, and deleting a book.

# How To Use

The Waifu API allows you to manage a collection of waifus. You can perform operations like retrieving all waifus, adding a new waifu, updating a waifu, and deleting a waifu. Follow the instructions below to use the API effectively.

* Local Host: Run with Postman, local IP and Port:5000 `http://127.0.0.1:9000/waifus` or `http://localhost:9000`
* Online Domain : not deployed yet

To test the API endpoints using Postman, you can download the Postman Collection and Environment files from the following links:

- [Postman Bookshelf API Test Collection dan Environment](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/a261-backend-pemula-labs/raw/099-shared-files/BookshelfAPITestCollectionAndEnvironment.zip)

To use the files in Postman, you need to import both of them. To do this, extract the files that have been downloaded to produce two JSON files.

![1688207497989](image/README/1688207497989.png)

Then, in the Postman application, click on the import button located on the top-left panel of the Postman application.

![1688207697380](image/README/1688207697380.png)

Then click the "Upload Files" button to import both extracted JSON files.

After that, the Bookshelf API Test Collection and Environment will be available in your Postman. Now you can testing the API without typing the endpoints.
